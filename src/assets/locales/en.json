    "welcome_description": "<p> Of the 1.9 million cars that are newly registered by companies in Germany every year, approximately 800,000 are part of company fleets. There lies the great potential for electromobility. Compared to the private use of electric vehicles company fleets offer advantages. The limited range is less of a problem when one has access to a pool of vehicles. The set up and use of charging options on company premises tends to be easier, too. Regular and planned use of electric vehicles could avoid usage conflicts and increase efficiency. </p> <p> But what are the total costs of a commercial electric vehicle compared to a diesel or petrol vehicle? How do the overall costs evolve over the years according to the holding period and annual mileage? How are greenhouse gas emissions reduced? </p> <p> These and other questions are answered by this online calculator by the Öko-Institut. It analyzes the overall cost of commercial electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles - i.e costs for the purchase of vehicles and charging infrastructure, gasoline and electricity, workshop visits, tax, insurance, amortization and vehicle residual value. </p> <p>Users can rely on plausible presets or adjust the individual variables manually to fit their own scenarios. </p>",
